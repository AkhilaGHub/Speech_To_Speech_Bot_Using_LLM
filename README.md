Speech-To-Speech Bot using Large Language Models(LLM)
**Overview**
This project is a Django-based application that implements a speech-to-speech bot. The bot captures audio input, converts the speech to text, uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a response, and then converts the response back to speech. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface to facilitate continuous dialogue between the user and the bot.

**Features**

🗣️ Speech Recognition: Converts user speech to text using speech_recognition.
🤖 LLM Integration: Generates contextual responses using OpenAI's GPT model.
🔊 Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts the LLM response back into speech.
💻 User Interface: Web-based UI built with Django, HTML, and CSS for a smooth user experience.

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x
Django 4.x
OpenAI API Key
Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)
