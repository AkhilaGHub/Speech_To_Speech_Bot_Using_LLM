# Speech-to-Speech Bot Using Large Language Models(LLM)

## Overview
**Overview**
This project is a Django-based application that implements a speech-to-speech bot. The bot captures audio input, converts the speech to text, uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a response, and then converts the response back to speech. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface to facilitate continuous dialogue between the user and the bot utilizing the Generative AI in the real world chat applications.
